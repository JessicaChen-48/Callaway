  <h3>Parks</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Welcome Park</strong></li> A custom-made welcome sign welcomes you to Callaway as you enter the shopping district!
    <li><strong>Civics Park</strong></li> A park dedicated to civics, including the Statue of Liberty, an oratorium for TED talks, a lush flower shop, and of course, the Bootyful self-confirmation walkthrough ripe with our home fruit, the wonderful
    peach.
    <li><strong>Rainbow Garden</strong></li>The lovely western neighborhood park filled with blooming flowers, coordinated by color.
    <li><strong>Event Patch</strong> </li> A small, but ever-rotating park for the eastern neighborhood. Updated to match the seasons, so check back often!
    <li><strong>Butterfly Gardens</strong> </li> Delicate butterfly models represent the bond between these magnificent creatures and their affinity to nature as you walk through this mini-park rife with an array of flowers.
    <li><strong>Callaway Catalog of Flowers</strong></li> As a part of the museum, the Catalog of Flowers containts one of every color and type of flower. Preserved and maintained by the ever-courageous Blathers, who may encounter a bug or two.
    <li><strong>Disneyland!</strong></li> Walk through Main Street as you experience Callaway's rendition of Disneyland. Dizzy yourself in the Alice teacups! Glide around the yeti (godzilla) in Matterhorn bobsleds! Enjoy a Dole Whip in the Tiki Room or explore space in Tomorrowland. Each land includes their own, unique popcorn stall.
    <li><strong>Whimsy Gardens</strong></li> The Whimsy Gardens sit below the giant Mickey arrangement. Full of mystical items, like money trees and moon chairs.
    <li><strong>Zen Garden</strong> </li> Need a break from the world? Come relax at the zen garden, tucked away in a little corner of Callaway. Relax at the rock gardens, peer into the natural pond, or take a tip in the spa.
    <li><strong>The Stage</strong> </li> Want to relive a movie or show? Come enjoy a play at the Callaway Stage! Offerings vary, but currently we are showing Naruto Shippuden!
    <li><strong>Forest Campsite</strong> </li> Tucked away and hidden by trees, the campsite is great for those who are looking to be one with nature. A tiny fishing hole included for your relaxation!
    <li><strong>Personal Gardens</strong> </li> A huge front yard can be seen as the personal gardens for the island representative herself. Come explore the wishing well, tea party, and flower breeding grounds!
